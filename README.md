# Karetech Solutions "Cheat-Sheets"

Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Kareem, a 27-year-old tech enthusiast from Guyana, and I love to inspire and educate people in IT.

This Repository **Docs** is my personal knowledge-base. Here you'll find code-snippets, technical documentation, and command reference for various tools, and technologies.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my YouTube Channel: [Christian Lempa](https://www.youtube.com/@christianlempa).
